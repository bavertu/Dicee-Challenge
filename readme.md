# Dicee

Dicee is a simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays two dice and announces the winner based on the dice rolls when the page is refreshed.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the dice game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the dice game.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic of the dice game.
- `images/`: A directory containing images of dice faces (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`).
